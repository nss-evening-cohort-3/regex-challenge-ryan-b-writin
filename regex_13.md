Born and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager; 
his first band, the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, 
Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, 
and songs such as "Give Peace a Chance", "Working Class Hero", and "Imagine". After his marriage to 
Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music 
business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album 
Double Fantasy. He was murdered three weeks after its release.
